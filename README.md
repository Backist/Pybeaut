## IMPORTANT!
```Recently the Pystyle library has suffered an update that contains non-legitimate code and that can put at risk your computer and your data, that's why I have been forced, as a good action towards the community, to upload my own module renamed as "Pybeaut" to continue giving the service that Pystyle used to give with no malicious contexts.```

**PD:** ``If you have any recommendations or new possible implementations of the module features, let us know through an issue in the official repository of the module or by posting a request in the official Pypi portal.``
